WikiDB
---

WikiDB is a Linux command-line tool for downloading web pages from the internet and archiving them in local databases. WikiDB features automatic sanitization features for injecting, removing, and modifying HTML. You may also extend and modify its functionality by configuring page sources in local configs. This software was originally intended for downloading pages from the Arch Wiki, but it can be used to download from anywhere.

This software is in an early stage of development right now, and is still in a pre-release state of development. If you are interested in using this software or contributing to its development, check out the [wiki](/PilotGuy772/wikidb/wiki).
