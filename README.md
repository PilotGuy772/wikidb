WikiDB
---

WikiDB is a collection of applications intended to download, index, and serve web pages from the internet.
WikiGet can be used to download and sanitize pages from the internet using wiki configurations. It is extensible
by nature, allowing users to define custom rules in the configuration files. WikiGet can also put downloaded files
into a local file-system database. WikiDB manages the local databases, and can be used to index and search them. 
WikiServe is a simple ASP application that allows users to serve downloaded pages on a local web server for a
seamless viewing experience.

Right now, WikiDB is in an early stage of development, but it will soon reach basic functionality. WikiDB's set of 
tools are GNU/Linux-only command line utilities, but support *might* come for BSD systems, MacOS, and Windows some 
time in the future.This software is open-source and is licensed under GNU GPL-3.0 license.

Full documentation for installing, running, and using these applications is in the works.
